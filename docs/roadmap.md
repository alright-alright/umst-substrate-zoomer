# Roadmap

- GPU kernels for harmony/order computations
- 3D GLB export of helix/chord lattice
- Cross-scale mutual information and spectral gap metrics
- Real UMST engine adapters (MPU, ChronoLayer, SSP payload semantics)
- Proxy-data adapters (neural oscillations, galaxy catalogs) with careful caveats
