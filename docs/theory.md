# Theory: Why the Substrate Zoomer is the Logical Next Step

**UMST** posits that all phenomena are instantiated classes of a universal mathematical substrate.
At human vantage, systems appear chaotic. When we **zoom out** (increase scale and bind signals), **lawful order** emerges.

This project operationalizes that claim by implementing:
- **Loops** as the primitive units
- **Harmony functional H** to quantify resonance
- **Order parameter R_k** per scale to track coherence
- **HASR**, **friction**, and **TSL** as the dynamics that modulate binding
- **Coarse-graining** to aggregate micro-loops into macro-loops (chords)

**Output**: a multiscale **lattice** of order, with falsification controls (null seeds, ablations).
